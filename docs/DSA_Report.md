# NexaKernel - DSA Report (scaffold)

Document how data structures are used in the kernel: where you rely on heaps,
tries, bitmaps and more. Include benchmarks or complexity notes if needed.

Sections:

- DSA list and responsibilities
- Memory-backed DSAs and persistence
- Scheduler DSAs (queues, heaps)
- File system DSAs (trie for filenames, hash map for file descriptors)
